# Trinket Helper

Trinket Helper is a plugin for use with BepInEx. This means that it doesn't modify any of the original gamecode but merely hooks onto it.

As you press the respective numbers for the trinket slots you can see the name and description for trinkets that you currently have. Such as pressing `1` would show you the name and description of the trinket you have in your first slot.

I created this as a way to help people remember what trinkets they have and what the trinkets do.

## How to use

1. You need to install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx#readme) to The Legend of Bum-Bo game folder.
2. Download the two files `TrinketHelper.dll` and `MMHOOK_Assembly-CSharp.dll`
3. Create a folder in `The Legend of Bum-Bo/BepInEx/Plugins` entitled `TrinketHelper`
4. Place the two files within `The Legend of Bum-Bo/BepInEx/plugins/TrinketHelper`
5. Run the game through Steam

## Simple Guide

If you have 1-4 trinkets then press the respective number on the top of your keyboard. Doing so will display the trinket name and description for that slot. So if you press `2` then it will display the name of the trinket in the second slot as well as its description.

## Notes

- Does not currently support numberpad inputs (due to me working on a laptop)
